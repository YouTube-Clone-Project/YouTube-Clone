## Contributors

### Loren Pabst
Loren worked mainly on the video page. Loren built the components on that page, including making the main video play, the API call to get recommended videos on the side, the title, description, and comments for the current video, and the 'share' link that auto-populates when clicked on. 

### Jessica Pabst
Jessica built the header, footer, landing (home) page, search page, and subscriptions page. The search page API returns results relevant to the search term. The subscriptions page is user specific, and the landing page allows the user to subscribe/unsubscribe from channels with those actions being recorded in the database.

### Ivor Anderson
Ivor built the Sidebar nav, the press page, about page, copyright page, creators page, advertise page, developers page, +youtube page, and 'the team' page. Ivor also helped develop a color coded system for tracking who was working on which part of the project, in order to avoid merge conflicts.

### Reed Mohorn
Reed built the server, the database, the login page on the front end, and all of the login/Auth0 functionality. Reed also built all of the back end endpoints, and helped teach team members about the auth0 functionality, and how to set it up.
